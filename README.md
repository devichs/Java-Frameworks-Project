## D287 – JAVA FRAMEWORKS.
My project will keep track of inventory for a customer that owns a music store.  The music store sells instruments and instrument parts.
### PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT STEPS.  
**B. Create a README file that includes notes describing where in the code to find the changes you made for each of parts C to J. Each note should include the prompt, file name, line number, and change.**

#### filename: README.md
This entire file was updated from the original file to track other project file changes.

**C. Customize the HTML user interface for your customer’s application. The user interface should include the shop name, the product names, and the names of the parts.**

**D.  Add an “About” page to the application to describe your chosen customer’s company to web viewers and include navigation to and from the “About” page and the main screen.**

**E.  Add a sample inventory appropriate for your chosen store to the application. You should have five parts and five products in your sample inventory and should not overwrite existing data in the database.**

**F.  Add a “Buy Now” button to your product list.**

**G.  Modify the parts to track maximum and minimum inventory:**

**•  Add to the InhousePartForm and OutsourcedPartForm forms additional text inputs**

**•  Rename the file the persistent storage is saved to.**

**•  Modify the code to enforce that the inventory is between or at the minimum and maximum value.**

**H.  Add validation for between or at the maximum and minimum fields.**

**I.  Add at least two unit tests for the maximum and minimum fields to the PartTest class in the test package.**

**J.  Remove the class files for any unused validators in order to clean your code.**

**K.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.**
